The system offers technology of outdoors vision based object recognition that will extend state-of-the-art location and context aware services towards object based awareness in urban environments. In the proposed application scenario, tourist pedestrians are equipped with a GPRS or UMTS capable camera-phone. They are interested whether their field of view contains tourist sights that would point to more detailed information. Multimedia type data about related history might be explored by a mobile user who is intending to learn within the urban environment. Ambient learning is in this way achieved by pointing the device towards the urban sight, capturing an image, and consequently getting information about the object on site and within the focus of attention, i.e., the user's current field of view. The described mobile system offers multiple opportunities for application in both mobile business and commerce, and is currently developed towards an industrial prototype},

Solutions involve more than combining functional requirements and creative novelty. To transform technical capabilities of emerging mixed reality (MR) technology into the mainstream involves the integration and evolution of unproven systems. For example, real-world applications require complex scenarios (a content issue) involving an efficient iterative pipeline (a production issue) and driving the design of a story engine (a technical issue) that provides an adaptive experience with an after-action review process (a business issue). This article describes how a multi-disciplinary research team transformed core MR technology and methods into diverse urban terrain applications.

Urban laboratories are emerging in numerous cities around the world as a strategy for local governments to partner with public and private property owners to reduce carbon emissions, while simultaneously stimulating economic growth. In this article, we use insights from laboratory studies to analyse the notion of urban laboratories as they relate to experimental governance, the carbonization agenda and the transition to low-carbon economies. We present a case study of the Oxford Road corridor in Manchester in the UK that is emerging as a low-carbon urban laboratory, with important policy implications for the city's future. The corridor is a bounded space where a public-private partnership comprised of the City Council, two universities and other large property owners is redeveloping the physical infrastructure and installing monitoring equipment to create a recursive feedback loop intended to facilitate adaptive learning. This low-carbon urban laboratory represents a classic sustainable development formula for coupling environmental protection with economic growth, using innovation and partnership as principal drivers. However, it also has significant implications in reworking the interplay of knowledge production and local governance, while reinforcing spatial differentiation and uneven participation in urban development.},

They can enable learning when the user is en-gaged in everyday activities while out and about, complementing formal language classes. A significant challenge, however, has been the practical implementation of services that can accurately identify and make use of context, particularly location, to offer meaningful language learning recommendations to users. In this paper we review a range of approaches to identifying context to support mobile language learning. We consider how dynamically changing aspects of context may influence the quality of recommendations presented to a user. We introduce the MASELTOV project's use of context awareness combined with a rules-based recommendation engine to present suitable learning content to recent immigrants in urban areas; a group that may benefit from contextual support and can use the city as a learning environment.},

The study case is taken from a city district, Billstedt, in Hamburg, Germany. In the implementation of a game concept we concentrated on the design of a marketplace in Billstedt. The game was called "B3-Design your Marketplace!" The B3 game aims to provide a playful digital environment in which the citizens gain information about the current situation in the city district, have the possibility of submitting their own designs for the marketplace, vote for the preferred designs, and chat with the experts and other participants. The prototype of the B3 serious game was evaluated with a group of students and a group of elderly people. The majority of the participants involved in testing expressed appreciation for the digital serious game as a new form of online civic engagement in urban planning. The paper concludes with a discussion about the potential of digital serious games for civic engagement and open research questions.},

Drawing on an analysis of game mechanics, in-game actions, and interviews and focus groups with players, we ask if and how CPI can move citizen participation beyond isolated transactions. We draw two conclusions: CPI creates and strengthens trust among individuals and local community groups that is linked to confidence in the process of engaging, and it encourages interactive practices of engagement that we define as civic learning.},

The reliability, scalability and ubiquity are the characteristics that make these services especially convenient in supporting large group collaborative learning activities that require computer support in various settings, in and outside the classroom. In this work we first analyze the use of Google Maps for supporting a learning activity in an urban environment, concluding that some important features are missing. We then propose an approach for taking advantage of cloud computing services for learning activities by integrating different services in a new application. We conclude that this approach may be used for further developing applications supporting large group learning activities.},

	abstract = {The paper critically examines the experience in implementing an innovative pilot project from students and learning facilitators' perspective. It highlights examples of modeling innovative practice through research and teaching with emergent technologies in a frame of Let's play as architects in the city! project launched in 2012 as optional subject-matter for the third and fourth grade of elementary school. Developed by a group of architects (Grupul De-a arhitectura) and implemented in partnership with the University of Bucharest and Architects' Order, the project has an interdisciplinary approach and involves architects, teachers and University faculty and students. Project aims to make primary school students acquainted with basic concepts from architecture and urbanism by direct observation, neighborhood exploration and creative use of data gathered through a variety of ICT tools. Firstly the paper explores young students' textual engagements with mobile technologies and the changing nature of literacy in the context of being involved in an engaging complex activity. Project activities provide contextual learning experiences and rich exploration and discovery of the connected nature of information in the real world. Specific assignments reinforce skills development, use of mobile technologies and articulation to school curriculum: reading, writing, math, technological education, civic participation, arts and digital skills. Secondly the paper investigates the perceptions of learning facilitators' on the use of mobile technology for project implementation. Architects and teachers will provide narrative information on the balance between planned and unplanned in using new technology for classroom and outdoor activities with elementary school students, between types of emerging collaboration encouraged by use of mobile technologies. Instructors will reflect not only on strengths but also on the challenges in implementing this integrative learning approach. Thirdly, the evaluation of project implementation during the pilot phase will allow changes aiming at making of the extended phase a platform of quality education. Experiences gained in the frame of Let's play as architects in the city! could provide genuine examples about ubiquitous learning, where learning opportunities and experiences are dramatically changing (Burbules). Therefore we expect to stimulate research efforts that focus on key areas like mobile learning, new literacies (e-texts) and engaging faculty and students in the pursuit of digital perspectives to research and teaching.},

	abstract = {Disaster occurrence around the world has in the past few decades increased at an alarming rate necessitating an urgent need for mitigation strategies. As a result, research has indicated the usefulness of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in disaster risk management. Furthermore, ICT generally plays a critical role in all aspects of disaster risk management such as: early warning prediction; informing and circulating information relating to disasters to communities especially those at risk as promptly as possible and providing communication structures immediately after a disaster occurrence. As part of its planning and precautionary measures in responding to disasters, the City of Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Centre (CoCTDRMC) implements public awareness programmes across the city. The most acclaimed is an annual awareness programme especially for high school learners selected from various schools across the city. The learner participants are expected to act as change agents in their communities. In 2012, learners from twelve different schools across the city benefited from this programme. They were expected to educate families, friends, schoolmates and communities generally on the topical issues surrounding disaster risk management. This study uses a case study approach. Since the target audience of the programme is the youth, there is need to shift towards utilising ICT. The aim of this paper is to look at how e-learning as an ICT tool can be integrated in the implementation of Public Awareness Education Programme (PAEP), so as to target broader audience and create an increased capacity building across the City of Cape Town (CoCT). The examination considers providing tools that are accessible, dependable, resilient and flexible among the residents so as to reach the grassroots levels where communities are mostly affected. The paper considers a combination of tools so as to support behavioural change. Some of the research findings are that, the 2012 programme was very beneficial and successful. Henceforth there is need to target a broader audience, and although the CoCTDRMC does make use of some relevant ICTs, there is need for additional and upgraded technological resources. Also pertinent is the fact that e-learning can play a major role in making sure that a broader audience is reached if applied effectively. The findings of the research are of relevance to the CoCTDRMC and other municipalities across South Africa. The Centre for Innovative Educational and Communication Technologies (CIECT) at the University of the Western Cape can also use these findings to develop and implement an e-learning course for both employees of CoCTDRMC and other interested community members. This will guide them on how e-learning can assist in fostering a successful implementation of PAEP across the city.},

	abstract = {Introducing landscape architecture students to tame and wicked problems within design studios fosters experiential learning by placing students in the midst of real-world design problems. Ideally, such courses involve partners that serve in a position to provide periodic guidance in the form of comments on student designs. The following paper discusses an urban design studio focused on Baltimore, MD, some three hours by car from the studio location and involving two clients in different places. Distance from the site and multiple partners, one of them a team of ecologists, provide challenges to integrating outside input overcome by periodic web conferences, yielding student work that incorporates strong aesthetic content that integrates ecological considerations. This studio had a common constraint in older urban cores, a shrinking city, with the uncommon opportunity of more than a decade of focused ecological research developed through the [1] Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES). As part of the National Science Foundation's [2] Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), the BES supports a variety of community-based activities. Within the studio design initiative, input exchange included first-hand exposure to the inner-city community and was intensely supplemented with the research scientists and city planners by web conferencing. Regularly scheduled web conferences for design updates were conducted and resulted in constructive dialogue between collaborators. The design challenge identification and resolution was done primarily at a distance through synchronic and non-synchronic Internet technologies with these collaborators. This studio partner collaboration will continue with different inner-city neighbourhoods serving as focused prototypical design exploration/demonstration areas. This approach has benefited from the formalized feedback of the studio partners. Service-learning and community engagement that utilizes web conferencing presents an interesting studio model. This paper will discuss the lessons learned by the studio instructors from using this studio model including its cost effectiveness, technological challenges, and feedback received from the partners.},

@article{kashtan_outdoors_2013,
	title = {Outdoors {Virtual} {Museum}},
	abstract = {The information era is evident in the implementation of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in schools. ICT may be used to collect information, organize it, store and share it, thereby mediating between students and world phenomena. On the verge of the 21st century we are witnessing the emergence of paperless schools, e.g. schools that utilize digital books, notebooks and virtual labs as a substitute for paper books, notebooks and physical labs. Accordingly, students deal mostly, not with the physical world, but rather with its representation. This creates a parallel world, rather than a merging of the two worlds: the virtual and the physical. This may be linked to the core notion of Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, which states that individuals do not act directly within the environment, but rather artifacts mediate relationships with objects in the physical world [1]. Hence, tools, as well as ICT applications and the Internet itself, may serve as artifacts, which facilitate higher order skills and thus mediate learning in schools and beyond. Engestrom [2] argues against the separation between schooling and other learning experiences; he refers to it as the encapsulation of school learning. To overcome this encapsulation, he offers emphasis on the role of mediating artifacts in human cognition and learning. Environmental programs, being international in nature, may combine real-world experiences with ICT. According to Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, educational design and evaluation, whether in-class or with relation to the virtual environment, should reflect cultural-historical aspects of human activity. Effects of these programs should include indicators measuring sustainable changes [3]. The project described herewith, "Outdoors Virtual Museum" was designed in the spirit of the cultural-historical activity theory. A section of the Tel Aviv coast (Israel), where Levinsky College of Education and Alterman High School are both located, includes a natural wild area with a sandstone ridge and a wetland with some vernal ponds. It is the habitat of several species of plants and animals, some rare and endangered. This region is planned to undergo massive development as part of the city plan high-rise buildings for housing, roads, shopping malls and entertainment quarters. The project goals are to promote an activist-ecological agenda and to facilitate authentic learning in a technology-rich environment. Hence, by highlighting the natural value of the area, we achieve enhanced awareness among students, all of which are Tel-Aviv residents. The project involves 7th grade students and college education students documenting the nature life of the environment and changes due to the development process planned by the municipality. College and High school students, together with an ecologist and their science and science education teachers, toured the area several times and designed 7 stations representing diverse ecological niches. The exact locations were pinpointed using Google Earth. Each stop was then visited once a month by a group of students, measuring temperature and shadowing, and taking photos of the area, and documenting animals and plants. Each location was accompanied by a website constructed for displaying information, including photos. Websites were constructed using Google Sites by the students and updated on a monthly basis. In each physical location a QR code was incorporated, allowing visitors to access information on the websites. This project tackles the encapsulation of school learning by using ICT tools to mediate between the environment and the students. The added value of the product is the exposure of data and information within the community, as the QR-codes in the real world are in open spaces. Allowing their scanning and entering the web pages by all community members.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses adaptation and mitigation strategies as outlined in climate change scenarios. The adaptive perspective is closely connected to the concept of resilience understood as different views on nature's capacity to absorb shocks, renewal and re-organization. In constructing normative scenarios images of the future are generated illustrating potential ways of living, travelling and consuming products and services where certain goals such as a reduced climate impact are fulfilled. This paper argues that tension arising from climate strategies relying on either adaptation or mitigation strategies, or combining the two strategies, warrant further examination. In this paper the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation are discussed by examining processes of citizen-participation in constructing scenarios and applying the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We discuss this using the concept of deliberative planning processes as a means to achieve legitimate, effective and sustainable futures. As a part of this approach, we argue that methods for citizen-participation applied in exploring different science and technology options also provide useful insight for this type of planning processes. The theoretical arguments are combined with examples from environmental scenario construction in practice. The paper brings attention to tensions between sustainability content values, such as reduced climate impact, and more process-oriented values such as legitimacy, learning and participatory scenario construction. Moreover, the concept of open innovation processes is introduced to the context of participatory scenario construction comparing shared ground in terms of user-involvement in search of novel solutions and also increasing robustness of action plans implemented to reduce climate change.

	abstract = {This article concerns an investigation into a new methodology and computational tools facilitating a collaborative environment in the field of architecture and urban design. Desk research by way of literature search has been applied on projects in three countries. The results of the empirical studies have shown three problems in the collaborative environment: semantics, synchronisation and communication. Besides these handicaps, there are professional handicaps. The article sketches a scenario for a virtual environment for collaborative learning with network technology and simulation games. This will lead to a filter mediated interaction model. The scenario is illustrated with three screenshots of the interface. Practical, professional tools, based on the methodology and the mock-up, will be developed in an international effort.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on research into a mobile game about medieval Amsterdam. The objectives of the paper are to generate insights into how mobile game-based learning in secondary education affects pupils' knowledge: of medieval Amsterdam, their motivation for History and for the subject of Middle Ages, and their attitude towards collaborative learning. We investigated the effects of a game called Frequency 1550. Frequency 1550 is a mobile city game developed by the Waag Society in which pupils playfully acquire historical knowledge about the medieval city of Amsterdam. A quasi-experimental design is followed in which data have been gathered on the process of gaming and learning of 458 pupils from twenty classes of five schools. Qualitative and quantitative data have been gathered. In this paper the focus will be on the quantitative data. Pupils of ten classes played the mobile history game, whereas the other pupils followed regular project-based lesson series (control condition) especially designed for this project in strong co-operation with five History teachers from the participating schools. The results show that, on average, pupils of the game received higher scores on the knowledge test on facts about medieval Amsterdam than pupils who followed regular project-based lessons. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding narrative knowledge, motivation for History and for the subject of Middle Ages, and attitude towards collaborative learning.},

	volume = {20},
	doi = {10.1093/heapro/dai003},
	abstract = {During the period 1997-2000 a technical assistance project to build capacity for community-based health promotion was implemented in seven cities and one province in China. The technical assistance project formed part of a much larger World Bank supported program to improve disease prevention capabilities in China, commonly known as Health VII. The technical assistance project was funded by the Australian Agency for International Development. It was designed to develop capacity within the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the cities and province in the management of community-based health promotion projects, as well as supporting institutional development and public health policy reform. There are some relatively unique features of this technical assistance which helped shape its implementation and impact. It sought to provide the Chinese MOH and the cities and province with an introduction to comprehensive health promotion strategies, in contrast to the more limited information, education and communication strategies. The project was provided on a continuing basis over 3 years through a single institution, rather than as a series of ad hoc consultancies by individuals. Teaching and learning processes were developmental, leading progressively to a greater degree of local Chinese input and management to ensure sustainability and maintenance of technical support for the project. Based on this experience, this paper presents a model for capacity building projects of this type. It describes the education, training and planning activities that were the key inputs to the project, as well as the limited available evidence on the impact of the project. It describes how the project evolved over time to meet the changing needs of the participants, specifically how the content of the project shifted from a risk-factor orientation to a settings-based focus, and the delivery of the project moved from an expert-led approach to a more participatory, problem based learning approach. In terms of impact, marked differences before and after the implementation of the training activities were identified in key areas for reform, in addition to the self reported positive change in knowledge, and a high level of participant satisfaction. Key lessons are summarized. Technical assistance projects of this kind benefit from continuity and a high level of coordination, the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate teaching, and a clear understanding of the need to match workforce development with organizational/institutional development.},

UbiqGames are designed to be played outside of formal class time and over several days, alongside more traditional instruction in the topics covered in the games. Teachers can use class time to facilitate thoughtful reflection on game strategies and data generated through gameplay. In the UbiqGame Weatherlings, players collect virtual creature cards and "battle" other players in arenas based on real cities, which feature the cities' meteorological data from the recent past. Success in the game requires players to consider climate conditions and do short-term forecasting from this real weather data. In this pilot study, 20 Singaporean 10 and 11 year-olds played Weatherlings using mobile devices over four days, playing primarily outside formal class time. Survey and interview data, combined with server logs, demonstrate positive outcomes for students including strong appeal and high engagement, increased interest in weather, and self-reported improvement in weather prediction skills. Outcomes suggest opportunities for additional research around UbiqGames to probe this new model for game-centered learning.},

A project-based learning approach was then used to develop innovative solutions while validating their relevance in collaboration with gardeners that were taking care of the greenhouse. As a result, a number of practical applications for monitoring the state of the greenhouse were developed along with new practices for its maintenance. As participants were given the freedom to choose both the topic and technologies to work with, the course provided a learning experience that was tailored to suit personal interests and competences.

	abstract = {Fireflies are a unique part of the natural landscape at a global scale. Urban development and changes in the landscape can negatively affect firefly distribution and abundance. Assessment of firefly abundance through counts of bioluminescence flashes provides an environmental quality indicator that can be easily observed and quantified by citizen scientists. Researchers at Clemson University, collaborating with resources managers, educators and teachers initiated the Vanishing Firefly Project to engage citizen scientists with the following goals: (1) Science Inquiry-Engage citizens in scientific practices to understand the impacts of urbanization on environmental quality; (2) Service Learning-Increase the skill of citizens in making critical, scientific and informed decisions through community and service activities; (3) Sustainability-Protect natural habitats through effective land and resource management practices and (4) Stewardship-Provide opportunities for citizens to participate in environmental and sustainability studies and activities. The project began in 2010, and was initially a Field Day located in Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. Since then, the project has grown from a single day event, to a statewide field survey, and now a global event in 2014. The 2010 efforts were local and to realize our goals would require increasing citizen science participation from one location in South Carolina to a regional scale. Several issues were to be addressed that varied from technology development, data quality and management, citizen scientist training and motivation for volunteers. Our initial technology framework consisted of a single Google Docs webform that allowed users to submit their firefly counts, but we had no ability to engage volunteers during and after the initial submission. The technology framework at this time (2014) now consists of an iOS app, Android app and a webform that submit firefly counts, firefly behavior, ambient light measurements (iOS and Android app only) and habitat type to a real-time reporting and geospatial data management system. Our efforts have leveraged social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to support training, education and engagement. This paper describes project activities focusing on how our technology framework has developed and matured to increase the scope, reach and capability of citizen scientists participating in the Vanishing Firefly Project.},

	abstract = {Health games seem to provide for attractive play experiences and promise increased effects on health-related learning, motivation and behavior change. This chapter discusses the further possibility of mobile games acting as a springboard for communication on health and its correlations to the built environment. First, it introduces the notion of spontaneous interventions, which has been used to characterize co-design projects in which citizens seek to improve infrastructure, green and public spaces, and recreational facilities of their local neighborhoods by adding temporary objects and installations to the built environment. Focusing on interventions, which aim to stimulate physical activity, this chapter identifies potentials and challenges to increase their impact from an ICT perspective. Second, the chapter gives an overview into current research and best practice of health games which seek to enable interaction with urban spaces through mobile and context-sensitive technologies. Specifically, it highlights "self reflective" games in which players seem to adjust their behavior in response to interacting with real time bio-physiological and position data. Observing how mapping technology enables users to relate objective data to subjective context, the chapter identifies how health games may supplement future urban research and design in the following aspects: Raising attention to new complexes, stimulating participation, identifying locales for potential improvement and evaluating impact. The chapter concludes with an outline of future research directions to facilitate serious games supplementing health-related urban design interventions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The advancement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has brought opportunities for the development of Smart Cities. The Smart City uses ICT to enhance performance and wellbeing, to reduce costs and resource consumption, and to engage more effectively and actively with its citizens. In particular, the education sector is adopting new ways of learning in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through e-learning systems. While these opportunities exist, e-learning content delivery and accessibility in third world countries like Tanzania is still a challenge due to resource and network constrained environments. The challenges include: high cost of bandwidth connection and usage; high dependency on the Internet; limited mobility and portability features; inaccessibility during the offline period and shortage of ICT facilities. In this paper, we investigate the use of mobile technology to sustainably support education and skills development particularly in developing countries. Specifically, we propose a Cost-effective Mobile Based Learning Content Delivery system for resource and network constrained environments. This system can be applied to cost-effectively broaden and support education in many cities around the world, which are approaching the 'Smart City' concept in their own way, even with less available technology infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed solution has the potential to reduce the cost of the bandwidth usage, and cut down the server workload and the Internet usage overhead by synchronizing learning contents from some remote server to a local database in the user's device for offline use. It will also improve the quality of experience and participation of learners as well as facilitate mobility and portability in learning activities, which also supports the all-compassing learning experience in a Smart City. © 2014 Knowledge Management  E-Learning.},

Some novel designs have focused on the middle school years, when students tend to lose interest in science and formulate opinions on science self-identification. This chapter describes the effectiveness of developing informal physical science experiences for middle school students in underserved urban communities. Several cohorts of students have participated in inquiry-based physics and chemistry weekend classes that incorporated authentic applications from the urban setting, field visits to scientists' laboratories and museums, advanced educational technology tools, and learning complex scientific concepts. Participants reported significant improvements in their attitudes, knowledge, and appreciation of the physical sciences, suggesting that well designed constructivist physical science programs are potentially transformative in improving students' academic self-efficacy, confidence, and persistence in science, and positional advantage. The potential of early, rigorous experiences with the physical sciences is explored as a means for improving science participation and diversifying the ranks of future scientists. © 2013, IGI Global.},

Engaging these tensions, we offer a framework of student objectives for learning about Big Data with mobile technologies.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the implementation of online games to encourage public participation in urban planning. Its theoretical foundations are based on previous work in public participatory geographical information systems (PP GISs), play and games, with a special focus on serious games. Serious games aim to support learning processes in a new, more playful way. We developed the concept of playful public participation in urban planning, including playful elements such as storytelling, walking and moving, sketching, drawing, and games. A group of students designed an online serious public participatory game entitled NextCampus. The case study used in NextCampus was taken from the real-world question of a possible move of a university campus to a new location in the city of Hamburg, Germany. The development of the serious public participatory game NextCampus resulted in a physical prototype, user interface design, and a computational model of the game. The NextCampus game was tested with the help of two groups of urban planning students and presented to three external experts who provided valuable recommendations for further development. The critical comments questioned the level of complexity involved in such games. The positive comments included recognition of the potential for joy and the playfulness a game like NextCampus could evoke. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Developing a sense of ownership at the local community level in a strategic collaboration with the university body and technical schools is the key for the success of projects. In addition to the technology development, this paper also points to the importance of the mutual learning platform for information dissemination of development across economic sectors driven by MicroGrid technologies. This platform will offer RD advancements in various other technologies focused on energy sustainability. Our evaluation suggests that many of these technologies integrated even at MicroGrid powered levels such as a patent pending solar thermal/Fischer Tropsh system which can provide an efficiency of service beyond rural communities to include large urban centers. This paper will attempt to show that the proposed platform can serve as the drivers for efficient municipal town planning systems, resource management and as human resource growth catalyst. Several models based on previous publications around the development of modified micro grids are discussed to illustrate additional possibilities. These platforms are envisioned as primary building blocks for future system expansion. © 2011 IEEE.},

Software engineering practices based on cloud technology techniques acquire from the Web what is needed for rapid prototyping, capability of satisfying the needs of customers, market validation of pricing policies, marketing strategies. As an alternative to standard software engineering programming, this approach allows to specify the projects’ concepts by reaching stakeholders of needed ICT components to implement a prototype relying on SW components available elsewhere. Two sample cases clarify this cloud-engineering approach to the development innovation: 1) Program for Recovery Insufficient Grades in High- School (PRISC); 2) Social Mobility (SM) to reduce dependence on owned cars to satisfy mobility needs. The PRISC strategy is to focus on the learner and on how proficiency is assessed through grades. The action steps: 1) understanding is focused on the students’ study on schoolbooks; 2) assessment is delegated to exercises and tests managed in interactive Web environment on screens of mobile telephones or PCs; 3) students with excellent grades act as tutors by exploiting the social networks. The SM strategy focuses on exploiting the empty seats available in most cars in metropolitan cities with air pollution problems.

	abstract = {The aim of this research is to study the effectiveness of using videoconferencing as a tool for collaborative learning on water pollution among students from two secondary schools located in different districts. The poor water quality of the nullahs in urban areas aroused the interest of students from two secondary schools in Tin Shui Wai and Wong Tai Sin who had experienced the nasty smell of the water from Tin Shui Wai Nullah and Kai Tak River respectively. Students of both schools were quickly aware of the need to improve the environment around their schools. Through the use of internet-based videoconferencing, the students shared and learned from each other's experiences in analysing pollutants in their own water channel. With the help of governmental and non-governmental organisations involved in environmental protection, the students also exchanged ideas on how water quality can be improved. They conducted three video conferences thus far. These involved lectures, data exchanges and information sharing. After these conferences, the data taken from the school-based curriculum design, the students' worksheets, their reflections and the video-clips of lesson observation were analysed. This paper discusses the data collected, and the results show that students' interest was aroused and their learning outcomes in knowledge, skills and attitude were recognised. Teachers involved also considered the project to be an opportunity for teacher development and to enhance their own learning. © 2009 HKIEd APFSLT.},

The literature generally agrees on the need to broaden the participation base to overcome this difficulty. However, participation should not be limited to problem solving, but should also take place in the problem setting phase. This paper proposes a participatory diagnosis process for structuring the problem setting phase. We describe an experiment in a participatory diagnosis conducted with the residents of a Geneva neighborhood. The experiment began by identifying the residents' concerns, which were then reformulated under broader issues. Some 20 spatial indicators were built using GIS tools, and were then applied in a second phase of resident consultations to assess the relative importance of each issue. The ensuing priority issues formed the core of the diagnosis. The approach emphasized comparison between the daily experiences of residents and so-called official information (i.e. census tract, traffic measurement, and so on). The residents were therefore involved in a learning process that allowed them to consolidate or modify their opinions. The process led to the emergence of a clearly defined collective awareness that supplanted individual aspirations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In History education, narrative can be argued to be very useful to overcome fragmentation of the knowledge of historical characters and events, by relating these with meaningful connections of temporality and sequence (storification). In the game studied, students explore the history of Amsterdam by walking in the city, experiencing characters, buildings, and events, while using UMTS/GPS phones for communication and exchange of information. The History game was played during one day by 216 students, spread over 10 secondary school classes, in groups of four or five students. All information exchanged during the games was collected, and the game play and introduction of the game was observed by team coaches and researchers. The design of the game as well as the actual gaming process was analyzed with respect to how it evoked three types of storification: receiving (spectator), constructing (director) and participating in (actor) the story. Results show that the game evoked a mixture of these three types of storification. Moreover, these types of storification processes differently affected students' engagement. Participating in the story evoked high activity in the game but less awareness of the whole story, whereas constructing the story triggered awareness of the whole story. Compared to receiving the story, both these types positively affected the engagement of the students being active and motivated during the game. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges in second and foreign language education, is to create links between formal and informal learning environments. Mobile City and Language Guides present examples of theoretical and practical reflections on such links. This paper presents and discusses the first considerations of Mobile City and Language Guides in language centres, upper secondary schools and universities. The core concept of Mobile City and Language Guides is geotagging. Geographical locations can be geotagged either through GPS or by marking positions directly in, e.g., Google Earth or Google Maps. Students or teachers can add various kinds of information to geotags: Photos, audio, text, movies, links, vocabulary and various language tasks. This allows the student, in self-defined learning contexts, to down- and upload location-based materials with his or her mobile phone, for immediate or later processing. More and more students are able to afford mobile phones with multimedia and broadband Internet. The potentials of user-generated mobile- and web-based content are increasing. In these years, the internet is moving from the so-called Web 1.0 to the more user-centered Web 2.0, i.e. Weblogs, YouTube, Google Maps, MySpace, FlickR, etc. In an educational context, Web 2.0 represents an interesting development of the relatively monologue Web 1.0, where traditional homepages often only allow minimal interaction with the site content. This paper investigates the opportunities that Mobile City and Language Guides seem to give second and foreign language students to learn from informal, location-based, experiencebased and authentic materials; and discusses how language centres, upper secondary education and universities can involve informal learning contexts through student use of mobiles with broadband and Internet technology supporting second and foreign learning. Mobile City and Language Guides is only of several possible mobile and Internet-based language educational scenarios. The challenge for the future, therefore, is to develop and implement new, meaningful and exciting scenarios that strengthen the linkages between formal and informal learning environments.},

Accessing this information at the given place is often the key to understand it or at least it helps understanding the information much better than accessing it elsewhere. e-Learning systems free the learners from the chains of time and place. However they are normally used with PCs or laptop computers either at home or at certain premises. Especially in a city like Trier, which is full of history, it is easy to verify that learning about the Romans and seeing a picture of a historic site is different to the real world experience of this site. This reflection leads us to the idea to extend the capabilities of a conventional E-learning system in a way that information can be accessed where it can be understood more easily, i.e. on its place. Therefore we have extended the system MOVII (Moving Images and Interfaces), which is a flexible and visually appealing E-learning Platform with a possibility to geocode information entities and to access them appropriately.},

	abstract = {Visual cues are a very helpful means of learning an environment easily and quickly. People who are blind cannot access many of the cues that guide most people. Likewise, those with developmental disabilities can often not understand signs and cues in the environment. This talk will look at several studies that have pointed out technologies, training, and techniques that can assist these two groups to better understand spatial information and lead to better spatial decision making and cognitive maps. People who are blind or visually impaired exhibit a wide range of spatial abilities, just like their sighted counterparts. The literature shows an equally wide range of theories on the ability of this group to accurately acquire spatial knowledge and the ability to construct valid and useful cognitive maps. Spatial information is especially important when dealing with novel environments. This presentation first reports on an experiment that used auditory cues (Talking Signs® Remote Infrared Audible Signage [RIAS]) to increase environmental awareness in a multi-modal urban transit station. One group of participants used their regular methods of orientation and travel while the others used the additional auditory cues. Two types of tests were conducted to measure spatial knowledge acquisition. Participants were given two opportunities to make a shortcut, if they were aware of its presence. In both instances, those that used the auditory cues were vastly superior in their ability to make distance-saving shortcuts. In addition, a set of spatial relationship questions was examined. Those that used the auditory cues answered these questions much more accurately than those that used their regular methods. Participants' times to complete various search and travel tasks, the number of errors made, and the number of requests for help from others were all superior when using the auditory cues. These additional auditory cues gave information that is not normally available and it appears that poor spatial awareness (a major problem of blind navigation) is the lack of accessible cues in various environments, not an inherent cognitive processing flaw of these individuals. Examples from work by other researchers will be discussed in the presentation. We summarize a study that tested RIAS in a subway station with a group of people who had developmental disabilities. They better understood the auditory signage information then when they tried to read that information. We also give examples from studies that tested various techniques to help blind people learn an environment, such as making sure that all cues at decision points were salient to the user, making a verbal report, constructing a model, and pointing at various visited objects. Two studies showed that when blind people were trained in these techniques, they preformed much better than without this training, and in one study, blind people were able to learn a complicated route almost as well as a sighted control group. © Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag 2006.},

This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.},

Several algorithms for polymorphic and animated maps’ reconstruction, both bi-dimensional and tridimensional, will be examined and described in detail. Among these algorithms, a further differentiation is made between those concerning proximal, or hierarchical development, and those regarding gravitational developments. In the latter one the positioning of nodes derives from quantitative values, that express their relation’s attractive strength. Conclusions derived from this work are the unavoidable need to implement maps’ dynamic reconstruction algorithms, when the complexity of the disciplinary ontology makes the traditional static approaches unable to provide an effectively usable image of the map.},

	title = {Scenarios for active learning in smart territories},
	abstract = {This work is intended to foster a “quantum leap” in the reflection on learning in smart cities/territories. We try to move from a vision according to which education is identified with “infrastructures and services” needed to sustain the smart city “organism” (due also to the social capital that it may produce) toward a “new” vision that recovers the founding role of the educative processes, through which the relationships between persons and inhabited territories are continuously reshaped. According to that we present: a) a
strategic and methodological approach focused on museal field and narrative as key elements of future 'learning from smart cities'; b) a model of an advanced integrated technological environment (mobile, web, internet of things) designed to support such an approach. The need for a different approach to the monitoring of complex learning experiences is also underlined.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the role context plays in promoting engagement
and exploration in situated learning experiences during field trips. We
look at field trips where children engage with the physical and social context in
order to learn about cultural and social aspects of the city they live in. By drawing
on empirical data collected by means of qualitative methods, we discuss
how learning unfolds along trajectories of experience towards pre-defined and
emerging learning objectives. We reflect of the role technology can play in supporting
learning experiences outside the classroom.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss how location-based mobile games can be
designed for learning in modern technology enhanced public spaces. We start
with the description of the design process and we identify the main challenges
faced. We elaborate the case of the game Invisible City: Rebels vs. Spies, a
game to be played in a city centre using mobile devices. Through this case we
highlight the adaptation of an original party game into a mobile form, the issues
we faced and the key aspects conductive to learning in a smart city. It is
claimed that creating mobile city games for learning is a new challenge, as our
city landscapes are augmented with an increasing number of layers of digital
information in which a new generation of city games are played.},

	abstract = {This study aims to redefine spaces of learning to places of learning
through the direct engagement of local communities as a way to examine and
learn from real world issues in the city. This paper exemplifies Smart City
Learning, where the key goal is to promote the generation and exchange of
urban design ideas for the future development of South Bank, in Brisbane,
Australia, informing the creation of new design policies responding to the needs
of local citizens. Specific to this project was the implementation of urban
informatics techniques and approaches to promote innovative engagement
strategies. Architecture and Urban Design students were encouraged to review
and appropriate real-time, ubiquitous technology, social media, and mobile
devices that were used by urban residents to augment and mediate the physical
and digital layers of urban infrastructures. Our study’s experience found that
urban informatics provide an innovative opportunity to enrich students’ place of
learning within the city.},

	abstract = {We present our approach on how smart city technologies may
enhance the learning process. We have developed the CLIO urban computing
system, which invites people to share personal memories and interact the
collective city memory. Various educational scenarios and activities were
performed exploiting CLIO; in this paper we present the methodology we
followed and the experience we gained. Learning has always been the cognitive
process of acquiring skills or knowledge, while teachers are often eager to
experiment with novel technological means and methods; our aim was to
explore the effect that urban computing could have to the learning process. We
applied our methodology in the city of Corfu inviting schools to engage their
students in learning through the collective city memory while exploiting urban
computing. Results from our experience demonstrate the potential of exploiting
urban computing in the learning process and the benefits of learning out of the
classroom.},

	abstract = {Smart devices in combination with other digital tools have occupied
the cities transforming citizens’ urban experience. People are connected any
time and anywhere with their global identities changing their relation to the
local. People live in glocalities, where the local and the global co-exists.
Glocalities are unique and constantly changing in a lifelong-learning process in
which the citizen is in the centre. There is an urgent need for services to support
glocal, reciprocal and multi-episodic lifelong learning processes in digital urban
spaces. In this paper we define three key attributes that these services has to
fulfil for being the glue to connect and guide the complex technology-enhanced
learning ecosystems in smart cities: multi-channel, multi-objective and multicontext.
Finally, we give an example of these types of services and contribute
with an illustrative glocalised learning scenario showing how life-long learning
processes would be supported in smart cities of the future.},

how topics from two particular fields, such as Geographic Information and Elearning
Systems, can be mixed in order to contribute to the Smart Cities cause.
In particular, we introduce the Geographic Learning Object and discuss how
such Geographic Learning Objects can be used in a Geographic Information
System in order to provide information and learning content to the citizens of a
Smart City.},
